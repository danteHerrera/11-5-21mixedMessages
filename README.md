# Mixed Messages
=============================

## What does it do?
This program is a random message generator. It outputs a random message without the need of user input. A user can add a new city with activities and the program will be able to understand it. 

## Why did you start it?
I started coding this program because of the course on Codecademy, Full-Stack Engineering. It is the first 'portfolio' project, which means it is very loose in this criteria, and it is mainly just an idea for someone to program.

## What were some problems?
1. The first problem I ran into was not being able ot add anything to a object. All I needed to do was change the object declaration from let to const.
2. The second problem was that the new city being imported was not a string so I couldnt search for it.
